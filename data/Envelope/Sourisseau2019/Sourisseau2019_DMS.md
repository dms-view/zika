## Mutational tolerance of Zika Virus Envelople from MR766 strain

[Sourisseau _et al._, 2019](https://research.fhcrc.org/content/dam/stripe/bloom/labfiles/publications/Sourisseau2019.pdf) performed deep mutational scanning on the Envelope from MR766 Zika Virus to measure the preference of each site for each amino acid under selection for viral growth in cell culture.
Here we display those results.
At a site level, we show two measures of mutational tolerance (site entropy and number of effective amino acids) and the RSA.
At the mutation level, the height of each letter is proportional to the preference or mutational effect for that amino acid.
The data are displayed both "raw" and after re-scaling to match the stringency of selection in nature.
See the [original paper](https://research.fhcrc.org/content/dam/stripe/bloom/labfiles/publications/Sourisseau2019.pdf) for more details; the data displayed here are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/ZIKV_DMS_with_EvansLab).
